# Bubble Sort 🧋
- **Author:** Adelaide Baron 
- **Purpose:** Bubble Sort to ascending order
- **Purpose**: Requirement of week 1 Java with Sparta Global

## How it works 
The below method is followed n times, where n is the length of the array.  
1. Starting with index 0
2. Code runs through all of the array, and checks if the current index is smaller than the next. 
3. If it is smaller, they remain in that order. If it is larger, it gets swapped with the next. 
4. This process is repeated until the final index is reached. 
5. With the new array, we repeat the above process.. 
    - I.e. {3, 4, 2} 
    - 3 < 4 `TRUE`- they remain in order
    - 4 < 2 `FALSE` - 4 and 2 are swapped 
    - Array is now {3, 2, 4} 
    - 3 < 2 `FALSE` - they are swapped 
    - 3 < 4 `TRUE` - they remain in order 

### WIP 🛠️
- Refactor the code
